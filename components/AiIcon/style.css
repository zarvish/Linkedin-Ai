/*
This CSS uses the Tailwind CSS @apply directive to integrate utility classes directly into custom components.
Using @apply helps maintain consistency, improve readability, and make development faster by reusing Tailwindâ€™s
well-structured utility classes. It also follows DRY principles, reducing code duplication. By relying on Tailwind's
utility-first approach, we can ensure scalable, maintainable, and efficient styling, especially in components like
modals, buttons, and message containers.
